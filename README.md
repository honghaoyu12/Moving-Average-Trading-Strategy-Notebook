# Moving-Average-Trading-Strategy-Notebook
This is a notebook that implement moving average trading strategy for learning proposes

It is a replication of the notebook(https://github.com/aldodec/Moving-Average-Trading-Strategy-with-Python), 
and I have made improvements as part of the learning process.

Some of the packages have been changed and the notebook by the original poster cannot be ran properly. 
I have fixed these and viewer can run the notebook and learn to implement a simple trading strategy.
